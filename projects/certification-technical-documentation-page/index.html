            <header>What are the 5 love languages?</header>
            <p>The five love languages are five different ways of expressing and receiving love:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Words of Affirmation</li>
                <li>Quality Time</li>
                <li>Acts of Services</li>
                <li>Gifts</li>
                <li>Physical Touch</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Not everyone communicates love in the same way, and likewise, people have different ways they prefer to
                receive love. The concept of love languages was developed by Gary Chapman, Ph.D., in his book The 5 Love
                Languages: The Secret to Love That Lasts, where he describes these five unique styles of communicating
                love, categories he distilled from his experience in marriage counseling and linguistics.</p>
            <p>"We all may relate to most of these languages, but each of us has one that speaks to us the most,"
                marriage and family therapist Sunny Motamedi, Psy.D., tells mbg. "Discovering you and your partner's
                primary love language and speaking that language regularly may [create] a better understanding of each
                other's needs and support each other's growth."</p>

        <section id="words_of_affirmation" class="main-section">
            <header>Words of affirmation</header>
            <p>People with words of affirmation as a love language value verbal acknowledgments of affection, including
                frequent "I love you's," compliments, words of appreciation, verbal encouragement, and often frequent
                digital communication like texting and social media engagement.</p>
            <p><code>"Written and spoken shows of affection matter the most to these people,"</code> couples'
                psychotherapist Fariha Mahmud-Syed, MFT, CFLE, tells mbg.
                <code>"These expressions make them feel understood and appreciated."</code></p>

        <section id="quality_time" class="main-section">
            <header>Quality time</header>
            <p>People whose love language is quality time feel the most adored when their partner actively wants to
                spend time with them and is always down to hang out. They particularly love when active listening, eye
                contact, and full presence are prioritized hallmarks in the relationship.</p>
            <p><code>"This love language is all about giving your undivided attention to that one special person, without the distraction of television, phone screens, or any other outside interference. They have a strong desire to actively spend time with their significant other, having meaningful conversations or sharing recreational activities,"</code>
                Mahmud-Syed says.</p>

        <section id="acts_of_services" class="main-section">
            <header>Acts of services</header>
            <p>If your love language is acts of service, you value when your partner goes out of their way to make your
                life easier. It's things like bringing you soup when you're sick, making your coffee for you in the
                morning, or picking up your dry cleaning for you when you've had a busy day at work.</p>
            <p><code>"This love language is for people who believe that actions speak louder than words. Unlike those who prefer to hear how much they're cared for, people on this list like to be shown how they're appreciated. Doing the smaller and bigger chores to make their lives easier or more comfortable is highly cherished by these folx,"</code>
                shares Mahmud-Syed.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="gifts" class="main-section">
            <header>Gifts</header>
            <p>Gifts is a pretty straightforward love language: You feel loved when people give you "visual symbols of
                love," as Chapman calls it. It's not about the monetary value but the symbolic thought behind the item.
                People with this style recognize and value the gift-giving process: the careful reflection, the
                deliberate choosing of the object to represent the relationship, and the emotional benefits from
                receiving the present. </p>
            <p><code>"People whose love language is receiving gifts enjoy being gifted something that is both physical and meaningful. The key is to give meaningful things that matter to them and reflect their values, not necessarily yours,"</code>
                says Mahmud-Syed.</p>

        <section id="physical_touch" class="main-section">
            <header>Physical Touch</header>
            <p>People with physical touch as their love language feel loved when they receive physical signs of
                affection, including kissing, holding hands, cuddling on the couch, and sex. Physical intimacy and touch
                can be incredibly affirming and serve as a powerful emotional connector for people with this love
                language. The roots go back to our childhood, Motamedi notes, some people only felt deep affection and
                love by their parents when they were held, kissed, or touched. </p>
            <p><code>"People who communicate their appreciation through this language, when they consent to it, feel appreciated when they are hugged, kissed, or cuddled. They value the feeling of warmth and comfort that comes with physical touch,"</code>
                says Mahmud-Syed.</p>
